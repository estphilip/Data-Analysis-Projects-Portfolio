##   Project Overview

This project analyzes over 15,000 records from an Indian fashion retail dataset to solve a real-world retail problem: how to ensure high-demand products stay in stock while avoiding excess stock of low-demand items.

### Business Problem:

 Stockouts of popular items leading to lost revenue.
 Overstocked items causing waste and poor storage usage.
 Unclear impact of pricing and discounts trends on different customer demographics.

---

## Data Source

The dataset consists of 15,000+ product-level entries from an Indian fashion retailer, including attributes like product type, color, material, pricing, and sales demographics (men, women, boys, girls,).

---

##  Key Metrics Tracked 
- üì¶ Stock Flag (In Stock = 1, Out of Stock = 0, Unknown = -1)
- üí∞ Discount & Discount %
- üßç‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Demographic Target (Men, Women, Boys, Girls and Unisex wears)
- üßµ Dominant Material & Color
- üìà Variant Price & Compare-at Price                                                     
- Product Type & Brand Demand Trends

## Tools Used

 
 - Excel - Initial cleaning, exploratory analysis
 - Power BI - Dashboard development, DAX logic, data modeling
 - Python (Pandas)- Statistical analysis (correlation, regression, ANOVA)

## Data Cleaning & Preparation

A 9-step approach was applied to ensure clean, analysis-ready data:

1. Unified date formatting (fixed slashes/dashes)
2. Removed Excel color formatting
3. Filled missing values with descriptive placeholders:

    ‚ÄúUnknown Color‚Äù
    ‚ÄúUnknown Material‚Äù
    ‚ÄúOthers‚Äù for vague product types
4. Split mixed-size column into text size and numeric size
5. Merged Date and Time into a `DateTime` column
6. Cleaned all text fields (trimmed, capitalized, removed symbols)
7. Created new columns:

    `Discount`, `Discount %`
    `Stock Flag`
8. Removed duplicates using the `ID` column
9. Validated changes before analysis and visualization

## Exploratory Data Analysis 
[EDA](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cb65roWMMQTtG-C_zpuJkPO6bwJiw_hlqvVwJfZ_MMU/edit?usp=sharing) üëà

 Visualized stock status across brands, product types, and demographics
 Identified top-selling and slow-moving items
 Assessed discounting patterns by target groups (e.g., women‚Äôs seasonal spikes)
 Analyzed color and material popularity

---

## Data Analysis (Stats)

 Correlation Analysis: Strong positive correlation (r ‚âà 0.77) between discount and price
 Linear Regression:

   Each unit increase in discount raised the compare-at price by \~1.22 units (p < 0.001)
 ANOVA & Residuals:

   Demographics had varying sensitivity to discounts
   Weak correlation between discount and stock status (\~0.02), suggesting other influential factors

---

##  Results & Key Findings

 - Items with large discounts tend to be high-priced, not necessarily fast-selling.
 - Discounts do not guarantee stock clearance segment-based strategies are more effective.
 - Stock Flag and Discount are not significantly correlated popular items may sell out regardless of markdown.
 - Women‚Äôs products show seasonal spikes (especially August‚ÄìSeptember), driven by discount events.

---

##  Recommendations & Limitations

### Recommendations:

 - Use targeted discount strategies based on product type and demographic.
- Prioritize stock for trending product types like Straight Kurtas.
 - Incorporate demographic-based forecasting to plan seasonal inventory.

### Limitations:

 - No direct sales quantity data‚Äîfocused on price and stock availability
 - Data quality varied in some fields (filled with ‚ÄúUnknown‚Äù placeholders)
 - Limited time window for demand trend forecasting
